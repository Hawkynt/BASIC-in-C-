**‚ÄúThe header your C++ professor warned you about.‚Äù**

---

## üéØ What is this?

`BASIC.h` is a C++ header that lets you write code like it‚Äôs 1985 ‚Äî **but it compiles today**.

It gives you a **PowerBASIC-style fa√ßade over modern C++**, with macros like:

```vb
FUNCTION(main() AS INTEGER)
  DIM(x AS INTEGER)
  SET(x, 42)
  IF(x > 0) THEN
    PRINT("We're back in business!")
  ENDIF
  END
END_FUNCTION
```

Yes. That compiles.
No. I‚Äôm not sorry.

---

## üß™ Why?

Because BASIC was:

* Readable üßë‚Äçüè´
* Fast to write üí®
* Dangerous üî•
* Full of gotos and global state üòà
* Didn't have those ugly brackets and semicolons üóë
* Was my first programming language üéâ

And so is this.

Except this time, it's **C++** wearing BASIC's skin.

## üî® What‚Äôs Inside?

### üß± Structured Syntax

| BASIC            | C++ with BASIC.h                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `DIM x AS INT`   | `DIM(x AS INTEGER)`             |
| `SET x = 1`      | `SET(x, 1)`                     |
| `IF x > 0 THEN`  | `IF(x > 0) THEN`                |
| `ELSE`           | `ELSE`                          |
| `ENDIF`          | `ENDIF`                         |
| `FOR i = 1 TO 5` | `FOR(i, 1, 5)`                  |
| `NEXT`           | `NEXT`                          |
| `DO LOOP`        | `DO ... LOOP` or `LOOP_FOREVER` |
| `FUNCTION`       | `FUNCTION(name(...) AS TYPE)`   |
| `RETURN`         | `RETURN(value)`                 |
| `END`            | `END` (yes, no semicolon)       |

### üñ•Ô∏è Console I/O

| Command        | Behavior                                 |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `PRINT(...)`   | Sends to `std::cout << ...`              |
| `INPUT(x)`     | Reads into `x` from `cin`                |
| `CLS()`        | Clears screen (WinAPI, no system())      |
| `LOCATE(y,x)`  | Moves cursor to line/column              |
| `COLOR(fg,bg)` | Sets color via `SetConsoleTextAttribute` |

### üß† Types

```cpp
INTEGER ‚Üí int  
LONG    ‚Üí long  
SINGLE  ‚Üí float  
DOUBLE  ‚Üí double  
STRING  ‚Üí std::string  
BYTE    ‚Üí unsigned char  
BOOLEAN ‚Üí bool
```

Because `auto` is too fancy for 80s kids.

## üß™ Math & Conversion

```cpp
CINT(x)   ‚Üí (int)(x)  
CSNG(x)   ‚Üí (float)(x)  
CDBL(x)   ‚Üí (double)(x)  
CSTR(x)   ‚Üí std::to_string(x)  
LEN(x)    ‚Üí length of string (supports std::string & char*)  
RND()     ‚Üí float between 0.0 and 1.0  
RANDOMIZE_TIMER() ‚Üí seed with time  
TIMER()   ‚Üí current time in seconds
```

## ‚ò¢Ô∏è What‚Äôs the Catch?

* üß® You‚Äôre committing crimes against both C++ and BASIC simultaneously
* üß† Nested `FOR` loops? We made that work with line-number macros
* üï≥Ô∏è You will enter a state of macro-induced madness
* üßº Your linter will cry
* üëÅÔ∏è‚Äçüó®Ô∏è Your teammates will **never trust you again**

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Madness Inside‚Ñ¢)

This entire monstrosity operates on a volatile cocktail of macro abuse, template trickery, and type-correct chaos. We simulate structured BASIC syntax using C++ macros that expand into scoped blocks, control flow, and even variable declarations ‚Äî complete with type inference and BASIC-style AS TYPE syntax. We use UNIQUE identifiers based on _ _ LINE _ _ to prevent loop collisions (so you can nest a FOR inside a FOR_STEP inside a FUNCTION and somehow sleep at night). Type conversions like CINT, CSTR, and LEN are powered by a symphony of static_casts and overload-resolved templates that pretend C++ is duck-typed ‚Äî until the compiler reminds you that it‚Äôs not. Even the CLS() function rewrites the console buffer byte-by-byte via Windows API, just so we don‚Äôt call system("cls") like a peasant. It's a macro metaverse. A DSL fever dream. A header file so cursed and beautiful it probably qualifies as modern art.

## üí° Why You Might Actually Use It

* Teaching programming in a friendly syntax (but secretly C++)
* When there's just no BASIC interpreter around your toolbox but a GCC at hand
* Porting old BASIC algorithms to C++ with minimal effort
* Writing **console games** like Snake, Nibbles, etc.
* Because you can. And shouldn't. But still can.

## üêç Example: Snake in BASIC.h

Just look inside this repository's **ConsoleSnake** solution to see how weird this can be.

Yes, I made this compile.
Yes, it moves a snake across the console.
No, it‚Äôs not okay. 
Yes, it‚Äôs beautiful.

---

## üß™ Final Word

**BASIC.h** is a shrine to weirdness, a playground for nostalgia, and a tool for creating retro magic inside modern compilers.

You're not just writing C++.

You're writing BASIC.
In C++.
And getting away with it.
